# MEAN-SEAN-skeleton-generator

###To install:
`npm install -g lambda-mean-generator`

and run it in any new root project folder with:
`lambda-skeleton`
###or:
`banana-sandwich`

Will generate a SEAN stack skeleton with files and dependancies. Designed to be lightweight, and a personal good jumping off point to exploring some of Node's file system server functionality.

The program will generate a skeleton for a Sean stack app with a configured package.json. It will include by default Angular, Postgresql, Express, Bootstrap, Passport, and several utility packages as well as a configured gruntfile to bring these into the file structure.

Eventually this will be a more modular application, allowing users to configure and save their own file structure, as well as qualifying through user prompts (commander) the npm packages to install (Mongo or PSQL, jQuery or Angular, which Angular modules, etc....)

Please feel free to contribute to this project! I made this as a learning opportunity and would love to start learning how to collaborate with people.

Here's to never making an entire folder tree again!
